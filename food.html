        <h2>Pecak Bandeng üêü</h2>
        <p>
          Pecak Bandeng is one of the most beloved traditional dishes of coastal Banten. The milkfish is grilled or fried 
          to perfection before being drenched in <b>pecak sauce</b>, a unique blend of chili, herbs, and lime juice. 
          This creates a bold flavor combination of spicy, sour, and savory, enhanced by the crispy skin and juicy flesh of the fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than just a dish, Pecak Bandeng reflects the coastal communities‚Äô resourcefulness and culinary creativity. 
          It is often served at family gatherings, celebrations, and local festivals, symbolizing unity and togetherness. 
          Every bite tells a story of tradition passed down through generations.

        <h2>Sate Bandeng üç¢</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike typical satay, <b>Sate Bandeng</b> is a culinary innovation unique to Banten. The milkfish flesh is deboned, 
          mixed with grated coconut and rich spices, then stuffed back into the fish skin and grilled over charcoal. 
          The result is a smoky, creamy, and flavorful dish free of bones, making it a favorite souvenir for travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The making of Sate Bandeng is an art in itself, requiring patience and skill. It reflects the ingenuity of the Bantenese people, 
          transforming a simple local resource into a dish of national pride. Visitors to Cilegon often bring it home as a token of their journey.

        <h2>Rabeg üç≤</h2>
        <p>
          Rabeg is a historic dish deeply rooted in the heritage of the Banten Sultanate. This slow-cooked goat stew 
          is infused with a rich blend of spices, including ginger, cloves, and black pepper. The result is a tender, 
          flavorful dish with a balance of sweet, spicy, and aromatic notes that warms the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Historically, Rabeg was considered a royal dish, served to sultans and nobles. Today, it remains a beloved comfort food, 
          especially during festivities and religious celebrations. Sharing a bowl of Rabeg is more than enjoying a meal; 
          it is about honoring history and cherishing cultural legacy.
